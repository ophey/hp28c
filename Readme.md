Add a README, they say ... to

Help people interested in this repository understand your project by adding a README.

Hmm, yeah, I myself already am in need of help understanding my project. What am I trying to proove here, really?

According to an observant former room mate (from way back) I keep circling through these IT related topics, things, paradigms, whatchamIcallits, obsessions really, like LISP/Scheme, the Apple Newton, functional programming at large ... and he was so right, I mean, like spot on. Thats what I do. Fullstop

One of these has always been the HP 28C (as in *not* S), main reason because I bought one used in the early 90s, not knowing anything about it (e.g. that it had only 2K and there was already the S and maybe at that point even the 48). Guy I bought it from got himself an early Mac instead. Couldn´t blame him ...

Same with the other stuff, I got a Newton 2000 for outrageous money in like 1996, I even bought TI PC Scheme when it was new (88 or 89) and studied that with the SICP book. So may be it´s only because I am invested financially? Who kows?

First thing that got me in to programming though was a TI-59 and *that* I got for free. Still keep going back to that as well (emulator on my phone, the actuall device is in disrepair, as is traditionally appopriate). Fond memories ... the TI guys were real champs: I didn't have any docs on the Master Library Module so I wrote them a letter asking for one. In response they sent the manual with a note to the effect that maybe I could Xerox it and send the original back, seeing as it was the last copy they had? So, that is exactly what I did. Pre-Internet were amazing times that way ...

So, where was I, ah right, this is about the 28C. What about it?

For me it is some kind of sweet spot complexity-wise as well as regarding usabiliy. For one the extra alpha keys are awesome, compared to the later 48 models. I also really like the stiffness of the keyboard.

Aside: the extra keys are also the reason why you wouldn´t use an emulator on your phone. Emulation works great in landscape on a tablet, though.

And I would probably see some use for the extra features of the S model, like hierarcical menus and the bug fixes (mine is ROM version 1BB, it doesn´get any older than that), but maybe find them too complex.

So really it is down to the miserable 2K memory. Just think about it, the guy who wrote the fantastic "Customize your HP28" book considers the HP28C one of the worst calculators ever made. I felt sort of betrayed when I saw that [here](https://youtu.be/BOpzJRDbAnU?feature=shared), having bought a copy of his book in 1994 (in an actual book store, do they still have those?).

But then, limitations, they say, spur creativity. So with the rich set of functions available, and alternatives regarding programming (RPL, algebraics and UDFs), I´d like to takkle some tasks normally not associated with a calculator. I will draw on 71B modules for inspiration and maybe go through some of the examples of the "Insights" book (awesome read!) just to figure them out for myself.

Man, the 71, might just be something else to put on my list ...

So, I don´t know if this helps anybody. Maybe just a waste of time, even for me. But hey, that´s what I do.

Regards!
